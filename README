Contact information managed on a two level structure. 
Variable xref information is added to a base contact record. 
Contacts can then have an unlimited number of different xref entries added.

Address information is enhanced by the the use of the address package. This 
handles conversion of postcode data to full address details, so that we only
need to record shorthand address data.
